# AK7451-Arduino-library
Arduino library for reading rotation angle from AK7451 sensor. This IC by Asahi Kasei Microdevices Corporation (AKM) uses a built-in Hall effect element to perform non-contact rotation angle measurements in combination with a diametrically magnetized two pole magnet.
Communication is via SPI.
